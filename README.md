**Overview**

Created for the Godot Stable Release Party Jam, Dawn of the Duck is a survival game on the high seas.  Or rather, the tiny sea inside of a bathtub.  How long can you withstand the waves of rubber ducks coming to roast you?  How many can you sink?

Gameplay is very shallow; shoot the ducks to sink them, and avoid their fireballs to stay alive.  The more holes you put in them, the faster they will sink.  Be careful not to let your gun overheat, and remember it may swing more slowly than you might like!  If you find the game too easy or too hard, the difficulty level may be adjusted in the settings.
