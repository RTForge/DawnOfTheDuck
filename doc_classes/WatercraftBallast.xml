		Allows off-center weight to be added to a [HydroRigidBody]
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		By default, the mass of a [HydroRigidBody] is centered at the origin of the object.  Adding additional weight at various points can improve realism in some cases. The WatercraftBallast node allows you to position a point mass at a specific location.  This can be useful for cases such as:
		- Creating a keel on a sailboat
		- Simulating cargo on a ship
		- Shifting the weight of a rider
